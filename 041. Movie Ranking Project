<h1>The Best Movies According to Chris</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>This is a great story of adventure, thrill, and romance. <br />
    Great light-hearted story with lots of famous quotes.</p>
<h3>The Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>This is a great fantasy series, about a boy who doesn't know <br />
    he's a wizard and goes up against the darkest wizard of all <br />
    time.  It resonates well with many of the challenges modern <br />
    society faces.</p>
<h3>Indiana Jones Series</h3>
<p>This is a great adventure series with lots of action and <br />
    suspense.  I watched these movies many times when growing <br />
    up and it brings back lots of memories.</p>
